# GestoTranslations

Hello fellow translators,
first of all thank you so much for translating Gesto into your language.

In oder to translate Gesto you have to edit 7 files in Gesto directory:

°Gesto/Translations/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.BatteryAction/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.CCAction/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.CloseAll/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.PlayPauseAction/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.RespringAction/en.plist;

°Gesto/Actions/com.unknown.UnlockAll/en.plist;


Then email me the zipped translated Gesto directory at gabriele.filipponi@yahoo.it so i will make sure to add that in next updates :)

Already done:

°English;
°Italy;
°Spanish;
°French;
